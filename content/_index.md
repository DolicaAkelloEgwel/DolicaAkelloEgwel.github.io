Hullo. My name is Dolica. It rhymes with Monica.

I'm a tech-art doula at London College of Communication. Yes, that's my thing.

My _official_ job title is "Creative Data Specialist Technician" but that's less fun to say, and I think tech-art doula fits what I do much better. In essence, I help students at the college incorporate Python (and sometimes ML and generative AI) into their projects. They come up with the ideas and I help write the code or scripts to make those ideas happen. Hence the "doula" part.

I think I manifested this job because some years ago I was standing in the kitchen with my sister and telling her I wanted to have a job title that would make me seem interesting at a party. (She said "software engineer" _does_ do that, but I really disagree with her there...)

I'm also a meh powerlifter, a massive dweeb about underground music, and a sometimes-angler. I may or may not be interested in oneiromancy, and I'm kinda sorta trying to learn German and Dutch.

In December 2024, at the age of 33, I was diagnosed with autism. I feel it helps explain certain things, like why, even as a child, I felt a bit like a "boomer" and was always the last to pick up on new slang phrases in school. But it also un-explains other things. (I don't relate to having sensory icks all that much, I don't have the electricity-hearing superpower, etc.) Also my birthday is June 18th which just so happens to be Autistic Pride Day.

I've been told my family lore is quite strange and hard to believe.
